### Introduction

Often times, SQL is used as a stand-alone tool, but databases can be imported into R to harness the power of its visualization and efficiency with the ```tidyverse```.  Now we can take advantage of ```ggplot2```, ```stringr```, and ```lubridate```, as well as the SQL-like syntax of ```dplyr```.  More advanced queries are actually easier with ```dplyr```.  

On account of these advantages, this analysis entails importing a SQLite database and converting it to an R table for querying and analysis.  The data comes from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

* ```population``` - The population as of ```2015```
* ```population_growth``` - The annual population growth, as a percentage
* ```area``` - The total land and water area.

The data can be found from this [Github repo](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases)

### Getting Started:

```{r}
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
# the remaining packages can be found in the tidyverse package
# this is an explicit listing
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
working_dir<- "/Users/roberthazell/Desktop/Dataquest/CIA-Factbook"
setwd(working_dir)
```

Link the database once it's downloaded to a working directory.

```{r}
working_dir<- "/Users/roberthazell/Desktop/Dataquest/CIA-Factbook"
setwd(working_dir)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = paste(c(working_dir, "/factbook.db"), collapse = ''))
```

See the tables in ```con```.  The relevant table is ```facts```.

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

Now we can save this table to it's own variable ```cia_db```.

```{r}
# use tbl (required) to convert to tabular format
# then convert to data frame
cia_db <- tbl(con, "facts") %>% as.data.frame()
```

Here's the first 5 rows, to show it works:

```{r}
head(cia_db, 5)
```

Taking a look at the structure:

```{r}
str(cia_db)
```

The ```population``` column is of type integer64, which will cause problems when plotting.  To remedy, this'll be converted to a numeric type.

```{r}
cia_db$population %<>% as.numeric(.)
class(cia_db$population)
```

### Summary Statistics

Here's info on the minimum and maximum values each for population and population growth.

```{r}
cia_db %>% 
  select(population, population_growth) %>% 
  summarise('Min Population' = min(population),
            'Max Population' = max(population),
            'Min Population Growth' = min(population_growth),
            'Max Population Growth' = max(population_growth))
```

Several curious features stand out.  There's a *negative* population value, and both the minimum and maximum population growth values are ```NA```.  This implies the presence of ```NA```s for the column ```population_growth```.  

Let's see where the negative population location(s) is(are).

```{r}
cia_db %>% 
  filter(population <= 0) %>% 
  select(name, population) %>%
  arrange(name)
```

Notice the ```population``` of 0 for Antarctica.

And now for the locations with missing ```population_growth```.

```{r}
cia_db %>% filter(is.na(population_growth)) %>% select(name)
```

Also, what's that place with 7,256,490,011 people?  

```{r}
cia_db %>% filter(population == max(population)) %>% select(name, population)
```

### Histograms

Before visualizing some key variables, let's eliminate any rows with ```NA``` and non-positive or 0 ```population``` values.  Also, ```World``` will be removed.

```{r}
cia_db %<>% filter(!(population < 0 | population == max(population)),
                  complete.cases(.))
```

Now for the plots.

```{r, results='hide'}
# use results = 'hide' to remove consolt output ([[1]], etc)
# create function to plot each histogram and format x axis
plot_cia_var <- function(v) {
  ggplot(cia_db) + 
    geom_histogram(aes_string(v), fill = "blue") + 
    xlab(gsub("_", " ", v) %>% str_to_title()) +
    ylab("Number of Locations")
}

to_plot <- c("population", "population_growth", "birth_rate", "death_rate")
map(to_plot, plot_cia_var)
```

Several observations can be made:

* ```birth_rate``` is mostly between 10 and 20 children per 1000 globally

* ```death_rate``` is roughly symmetric at around 8 per 1000, though some locations are alarmingly higher.  We can see which locations have a death rate higher than 12 per 1000

```{r}
cia_db %>% filter(death_rate > 12) %>% select(name, death_rate)
```

Many of these countries are in Africa or Eastern Europe.

* ```population_growth``` is roughly between 0-150%, but a strong minority of countries are growing even faster

### Exploring Population Density

Population density is the ratio of population to land area.  We can compute this for each country and compare those results with [Wikipedia's](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density).

```{r}
cia_db %>% 
  mutate(`Population Density` = population/area_land) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Population Density`)) %>% 
  select(name, `Population Density`) %>%
  head(10)
```

This accords moderately well with the info from Wikipedia.  Have a look.

### Conclusion

This project examined some of the core variables of the CIA Factbook dataset, after cleaning data inconsistencies.  It demonstrates the elegance of ```dplyr``` syntax and it's semblance to SQL, as well as how to integrate databases into R/RStudio.
